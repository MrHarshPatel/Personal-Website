# PersonalWebsiteRedesigned
My personal website that holds my projects and notes. Created to learn more about web-development and for me to create a useful place for all my notes to be stored and accessed.

# Stack Used:
- Node.JS, Express, PUG (For running server side javascript and having dynamic rendering)
- mySQL (For storing my projects and notes)
- Markdown (For writing notes)

# Features:
1. Minimalist Design, with bright colour scheme

2. Allows notes to be filtered by subject

3. Renders Markdown into a beautiful notes viewer

4. Showcases github projects in a nicely formatted card view

# Planned Features:
1. Ability to search topics through notes (Possibly add Search Engine)
2. Add index-cards for definitions that are defined in notes (Allows myself and others to quiz)
3. Showcase different algorithms visually instead of just pseudo code!
4. Syntax highlighting for programming course notes
5. Write more notes and better ones (Images instead of just text)
7. Continue documenting and planning more features!
