# Lecture 2
- Focusing on 1st couple chapters in book
- What are the length scales of the cell?
  - Thinking of E.coli as small container of protein (micron in width) (1 femtoliter of volume 10^-15)
  - How many proteins are in an E.coli now?
    - (Python Script) (kiloDaltons to grams etc. convers.) (total mass/(mass of avg protein))
    - Proves cell is crowded environment.
    - How do things move around in an E.coli?
      - passive transport (diffusion)
  - (1/3 approx. around membrane proteins)
- How are cellular components partitioned during cell div.?
  - What mechanisms?
    - Active partitions
    - By chance
      - Give by the binomial distribution probability of n1 outcomes in N trials (script)
      - Standard deviation, probability (review)
      - *Graph proves* mRNA partitioned by chance
      - carboxysome all data is clustered below binomial line, so there must be an active mechanism (parA protein)
  - How to test mechanisms?
    - data
  - Mammalian cells (10-100 microns) much much larger than bacterial cells (~ 1 micron)
  - neurons even larger
  - Large length scale diff. between types of cells.

  - Eukaryotic cells = organelles (W/ membranes)
    - Macromolecular assemblies (Assemblies of many proteins)
    - 3nm diamter kinesin avg distance btwn proteins was 6nm so
    - What forces relevant for small length scale?
      - Thermal motion (collisions)
      - Electrostatic forces
      - Friction/Drag
      - Gravity (v small compared to other forces (other forces dominate gravity))
      - Elastic

- Next time: time scales + forces
