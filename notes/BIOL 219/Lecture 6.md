# Law of mass action
Concentration of AB in A + B --> AB
AB = k1[a][b] - k-1[AB]
FORWARD rate - back rate must equal how much concentration of AB we have.

What is the ratio of unbound to bound proteins at equilibrium.

[AB]=k1[A][B]-k1[AB]
/
[A][B]= K-1/k1 = disassociation constant

What does kD tell us about freq. of binding & unbinding?
- nothing. Tells us about equilibrium but not how fast these complexes are forming.

Proteins often bind cooperatively

Cell division
  - sharp response

In biology, all rxns are to some extent reversible.

Enzyme catalysis
[ES]=k1[E][S]-k-1[ES]-k2[ES]
[P]=k2[ES]
@ Steady State where [ES] = 0

## Main points:
- Be able to go from chemical eq. to mass action
- understanding of Kd
- Remember Michaelis menten eq mean and what is Km, what is Vmax and how are they related?
