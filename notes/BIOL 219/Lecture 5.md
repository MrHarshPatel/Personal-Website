# Side chain interactions
1. Primary Structure: just order of amino acids peptide bond
2. Secondary Structure: **SIDE CHAINS HAVE NOTHING TO DO**, Alpha helix is i+4. beta sheet no rules. Due to hydrogen bonds
3. Tertiary Structure: **R GROUP IS INVOLVED**, Ionic bonds, hydrogen bonds, and hydrophobic effect.
  - Cells have a polar environment, non-polar amino acids hate water so they get away from it. Non polar cluster in middle of protein, this allows water outside to have lots more degrees of freedom.

4. Quaternary Structure: **ONLY SOME HAVE THIS, ALL PROTEINS HAVE PRIMARY--> TERTIARY** Interactions between different polypeptides. Antibodies are 4 quaternary structure. Mostly beta sheets. ONLY happens if for their structure need to group up with other proteins
  - Interactions with each other:
      - H BONDING
      - Hydrophobic **SAME AS TERTIARY**
      - HETERODIMER = 2 different. HOMOdimer = same polypeptides
Glycine has JUST H for R group so it is very flexible therefore **DOES NOT WANT TO CONSTRAIN IN A HELIX**
Proline has a LOOP so it also breaks **ALPHA HELICES**

BACKBONE holds SECONDARY structure together not side groups.

Hemoglobin = slight change in alphahelice orientation due to binding of oxygen
Kinesin = LARGE changes, walks around microtubuoles, depending on ADP bind or ATP undergoes very drastic changes.

# Protein Folding
- Techniques for determining protein Structure
## X-Ray crystallography
- Have to crystallize protein, to form a regular periodic ordered crystals. IF xrays hit atoms they diffract/scatter. Therefore if they scatter with atoms in one and another in the other, the diffraction patterns constructively interfere to get a pattern with high and low signal intensity.
- Electron density map --> comp analysis to fit into atomic structure.
- HIGHER RESOLUTION.
- BUT need to have protein crystallized, so not all proteins can crystallize

## NMR spectroscopy
- Protein can just be in solution!
- Some nuclei naturally have magnetic dipole so those will align if you put it into a magnetic field
- Absorb radio waves, excite and emit some of the radio waves. The frequency depends on LOCAL chemical enviornment. Exposed on surface proton is different than one hidden inside protein.
- Chemical Shift DATA --> protein structure. Some variable, some static structures.
- IN SOLUTION AND GET DYNAMIC INFORMATION

## Protein Folding
-  Sequence of amino acids (primary (N->C)) --> ??? --> Folded structure ARROWS show N->C on tertiary struct.
- Protein denaturation
  - Folded state = native state
  - Denaturation = loss of secondary, tertiary and potentially quaternary struct.
  - STILL HAVE primary structure, but broken non-covalent interaction
      - Ways to break bonds in a protein:
          - Change pH
          - Heat
          - Lots of salt, breaks down ionic bonds!
          - Organic solvents (make solvent less polar)
          - detergents (soap, will denature as non-polar part solubilizes the hydrophobic core)
          - chaotropic agent (Ex. Urea): Very polar molecules. If you add them to water, break up H bonding in water.
            - Destabalizes the solvent, so the hydrophobic effect is gone and it is denatured.
      - Disulfide bonds (are rly strong and stable)
        - how would you break those down?
            - Add reducing agent

## Anfinsen's Experiment
- How can you test for protein structure?
  - Tube of RNA is structured b/c it works
  - Then adds reducing agent and UREA, this unfolds it...
  - Measures activity of protein and there is less activity so presumably must be non-structured.
    - Then removed Urea, and added oxygen (oxidized it, cystenes would not have disulfide bonds so may not have activity)
    - Started working again and activity recovered!
  - THEREFORE sequence determines structure!
  - Only adds oxygen
    - 8 cystenies so presumably, added oxygen then removed urea and measured activity. FOUND, LOWER concentration of urea = more activity.
    - PROBABILITY of 8 random disulfide bonds vs the ones you want for activity

- Thermodynamic Hypothesis
  - All info req. for folding is encoded in A.A sequence of a protein
  - Native structure is free-energy minimum
- Molecular chaperones, bind to hydrophobic residues and give protein time from reaching native state

## Protein Folding Diseases
- Mad cow disease (spongiform encephalopathy)
  - Transmitted by infectious proteins called "prions"
  - Misfolded proteins can template other misfolded protein
- Alzheimer's
  - Amyloid fibers
- Parkinson's
- Huntington's
