# Binding in terms of Energy
k^-1/k^1=kD

G0 = standard free energy @ 1 molar concentrations of all components

# Protein Regulation:
- Through level of proteins (Expression, degredation) **By changing amount of protein**
- Auto-inhibition **Inactive state until needed**
  - in inactive state: Kinesin's tail domains are attached to motor domains.
  - in active state: Kinesin is bound to cargo, therefore motor domains are free to move.
  - saves atp by being inactive
  - could prevent others from walking along b/c it would be attached
- Binding partners **Binding partner turns on**
- Post-translation modifications
  - Phosphorylation, adding phosphate group
    - Kinase, adding, phosphotase = take off
    - CDK protein, regulates cell cycle
      - has phosphate been added?, has another P been removed? is cyclin present?
      - if all yes then TURN ON
ratio of E levels = fractions of active/inactive



G(s,p) = (1 - p)  --> (inactive case, active case)
            +
         (p)
