# Molecular Elasticity
- Force extension curve, 0 then tension force

- At the molecular scale:
  - Thermal, viscous, bonds

# Estimation of biological values
- Cell cycle duration for bacteria: ~ an hour
- 2^(n) where n = number of cell cycles to get # of biological cells

## Example:
- How can you use knowledge of flu season for cell division?
  - You get sneezed on. How long does it take till your sick?
  - 1 Day
  - Say you feel symptoms after b=10e9, how many generations of bacteria is that?
  - n = 33 generations. Therefore bacteria takes 44 min to divide.

- Thermal forces must be overcome by a cell for order.
- Energy = kT (k = boltzman constant)
  - Hydrolyze ATP to release 20kT
- Get joules with kT. Since J=N*m, we can estimate amount of force

- Estimating mass of yeast cell from picture 100x magnification
  - Measure in picture divide by 100 and that's the estimate of size
  - Volume of sphere, estimate density (of water) to get mass

- Hairs on a human head estimation
  - Software called collitis
