# Introduction to Algorithms

## What is an algorithm?
An algorithm is a systematic procedure that leads to answer a question or solve a problem.
  - An algorithm **MUST** have an input and an output.

## What makes a good algorithm?
- **Correctness, Speed, Space and Simplicity**
- **Speed:** Reduce Time, **Space:** Amount of memory, **Simplicity:** Easy to debug, modify, update

## 5 Things a good algorithm must have:
 **Input, Output, Finiteness, Effectiveness and Definiteness** ***(IO FED)***
- **Finiteness**: Terminate after finite steps.
- **Effectiveness**: Every operation needs to be simple.
- **Definiteness**: There must be a reason for each operation.

## How to measure running time of an algorithm?
**Running Time** is defined as:
- A function dependent on the size of the input (n)
- Mostly measured on _worst case_ as:
  - It is easier to estimate, and a good safety measure

## How are algorithms described?
**Pseudo Code**: Universal language independent of programming language
- Algorithms usually are defined 1st with input & output then the code is written in pseudocode

## List-intersection problem
- Input: List of 2 sets of students
- Output: Want to find # of students in both lists
- Optimization: Minimize # of times two names are compared
