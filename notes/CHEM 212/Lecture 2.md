# Lecture 2
- Structural Isomer: Same chemical formula, different arrangement of atoms
- Resonance structures: Same arrangement of atoms, flow/movement of electrons

# Molecular Orbital Theory
- \# of atomic orbitals = \# of molecular orbitals.
- node = 0% chance of finding electron
- bonding orbital (in phase) = lower energy b/c 2 nuclei pull without a node so larger space greater E
- anti-bonding (out of phase) = higher E state *explanation in lec*
- Bond Order = (# bonding electrons - # anti-bonding electrons)/2. Lines btwn atoms
- Molecular orbitals = combined. Atomic orbitals = not bonded yet
- Fill low energy to high energy, singly degenerate before pairing
- Bond order of 1/2 = unstable exists, more stable than 0 bond order
- Bond order > 0 = theoretically possible bond

# MO descriptions of pi-systems + resonance hybrids
- mobile e- = free flowing e- in resonance
- non-bonding MO = same E level as AOs
