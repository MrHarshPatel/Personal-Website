# H-bond acceptors
- ALL N,O,F

# Amines would you predict to have highest boiling point?
- NH3, CH3NH2, (CH3)2NH, (CH3)3N.
- (CH3)3N can't make hydrogen bonds so with molecular weight it's (CH3)2NH
- WITHIN similar weight, intermolecular forces are more significant.

# Simple-Branched Groups
- SLIDE ON iso-butyl stuff

- **CARBON 1 IS ALWAYS** WHERE it attaches to main chain!!!!, then largest chain
- Example on slide: 2 methyl groups, (1-ethyl-1,3,3-trimethylbutyl) Group! (complex substituents)

- Example 2 on slide: whole molecule:
  - just methyl comes first, methylbutyl comes second
  - 1,1-dimethyl-3-(1,1,3-trimethylbutyl)cyclooctane

- IUPAC System of Naming Alkyl Halides
- Example: #numbering of carbons want 1st substituent lowest then..., tie, look to total number then alphabet
    - 3-chloro-5-methyl heptane
- Example: Cyclic Alkyl Halide
    - 5-bromo-1-chloro-2-methyl cycloheptane **IN NAME organized alphabetically not by numbers**
- Practice Examples:
    - 3,3,8-triflurodecane
    - 2,8,8-triflurodecane
    - 3-chloro-1-cyclobutylhexane **Cyclobutyl COUNTS AS C not b!**
    - 3-bromo-4-propylnonane **IF TWO CHAINS ARE SAME SIZE WANT MORE SIMPLE SUBSTITUENTS!**

## Naming Alcohols
### Linear Alcohols
  - Select longest chain that CONTAINS the OH GROUP!
  - OH GROUP GETS LOWEST number no matter what
  - change ending to OL
- Example:
  - 3-isobutyl-2-heptanol OR 3-isobutyl-heptan-2-ol
  - 2-nitro-4-phenyl-cyclopentanol **DROP 1 for alchols**
  - 4-bromo-cyclohexan-1,3-diol
  - 8-fluro-nonan-3-ol

## Bicyclic Compounds
- Bicycloalkanes: 2 rings, only sigma bonds! CnH2n-2
1. Determine # of carbon atoms in both rings
2. add prefix bicyclo- to name of alkane
3. Carbon atoms common to all rings = BRIDGEHEADS. BRIDGE = BRIDGE!
4. LONGEST BRIDGE 1st!

- Example: 8-methylbicyclo[4,3,0]nonane
- Practice:
  - 8-methylbicyclo[3,2,1]octane
  - 1-isopropylbicyclo[2,2,2]octane

## Alkenes
- same thing but -ene
- UNITS OF UNSATURATION 2 Hs LOST = 1
- ALCOHOLS 1st THEN ENE, RING double bond = carbon 1/2.
- Alkenes as substituents. Ethenyl = vinyl. 2-propenyl = allyl
- Example:
  - 7-bromo-5,2-dimethyl-2-octene OR oct-2-ene
  -  6-methyl-6-octen-3-ol OR 6-methyloct-6-en-3-ol
  - CIS TRANS ISOMERS **CHAPTER 5 MORE DETAIL**
