# Alkenes Practice
## Examples:
- 3-ethylcyclopentene
- **Note: RING 1st** 1-chloro-2-ethenylcyclopentane **Also, vinyl = ethenyl**
- cis-5-methylhex-2-ene

# Alkynes
- **Note: No cis-trans b/c linear, 2 more units of UNSATURATION.**

- PRIORITY ORDER: OH > C=C, CTRIPLEC > Halides/alkyl

- 7-methyloct-5-yn-2-ol OR 7-methyl-5-octyn-2-ol   **Note: When yne is not very end its just yn, same with ene**
- ALkyne and Alkene Example:
  - hept-1-en-6-yne **same priority e before y**
- Practice:
  - 3-ethynlcyclohexene
  - hept-6-en-1-yn-3-ol

##Alphabetization Summary
Yes - look to first NAME
  1. Proper Substituent names (iso, cyclo, neo, bi)
No - look to proper names
  1. Numerical prefixes (di, tri, tetra)
  2. Italisized prefixes (tert, sec)

# Units of Unsaturation
- Rings lose 1, pi bond = lose 1.


# Conformations
- Conformations of Ethane
  - Ethane sigma bond rotation:
    - angle of front to back (dihedral angle) Can pick multiple depending on pieces we are comparing
  - Newman projections
    - Red circle = back carbon, lines out of big circle = bonds to back carbon
  - 2 types of conformations:
    - Staggered and Eclipsed
    - Eclipsed = stacked on top of each other, drawn askew a little
  - CONFORMATIONS: molecular shapes that result from sigma-bond rotation
  - Staggered conformation is favoured
    - Eclipse e- clouds are closer together.
      - Minimum Steric Repulsion - Bonding orbitals (electron clouds) as far as part as possible
- Butane sigma bond rotation
  - Syn confomration = non-hydrogen groups eclipsing
  - Gauche conformation = staggered
  - Eclipsed conformation= non-hydrogen groups not eclipsing each other
  - Anti conformation= non-hydrogen groups at top and bottom
- ANTI = global minimum. Syn = absolute maximum. Gauche and eclipse in btwn
- Zig zag is actually loswet confirmation (anti)
