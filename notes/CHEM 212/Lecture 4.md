## Select the strongest type of bonding orbital:
- Pi Bond, Sigma bond, or sigma-pi anti-bonding orbital
- Answer: Sigma bond, stronger however as a side note pi bond can't rotate around axis
- Sigma = more overlap between orbitals

## Chapter 2 - Families of Carbon Compounds
- Review functional groups, saturated & unsaturated
- Electronegativity = ability of an element to attract **BONDING** electrons
- Pauling scale of Electronegativity

- Other features that play in bonds H-F bond is stronger than H-H and F-F average.w
- e- spend more time closer to fluorine, this creates partial charges which increase bond strength/Energy
- bonds between atoms with electronegativity = 0.5-1.9 *not strict*

- double bond o makes h-bond b/c lone pair

- molecule coded in fluorines = weakest dispersion forces since fluorine holds electrons tightly
- if all non-polar dispersion forces then amount of dispersion (max surface area contact) = strongest
  - need max polarizability (tube shape has more surface area contact as the others are more round*)
## Aprotic solvents vs protic solvents
- Protic = things like water or alcohol. Have ability to hydrogen bond with solute & can dissolve ions well (water)
- Aprotic - do not possess a H-bond (acentone)
